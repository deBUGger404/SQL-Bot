# InsightGenix: The SQL Assistant
InsightGenix is an open-source Python framework designed to simplify SQL query generation, enhance data understanding, and facilitate insights extraction directly within Streamlit applications. Inspired by the convenience of modern AI tools, InsightGenix leverages the power of language models to interpret natural language requests into executable SQL queries, offering a streamlined approach to database interaction and data analysis.

## Features
- **SQL Query Generation:** Converts natural language questions into SQL queries.
- **Streamlit Integration:** Seamlessly embeds into Streamlit apps for interactive data exploration.
- **Customizable Sidebar:** Provides a tailored experience with options for setup, documentation, and file uploads.
- **Extensible Framework:** Designed to be easily extended with new features or adapted to various databases.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Ensure you have Python and Streamlit installed in your environment, then install InsightGenix using pip:

```bash
pip install insightgenix

### Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to set up InsightGenix within a Streamlit app:

```python
import streamlit as st
